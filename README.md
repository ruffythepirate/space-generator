This project aims at generating space backgrounds that can be used in for example art or game projects. By generating the art there's no potential issue with copyright / legal etc.

The wished arch of this project is:
1) Generate a static background that looks varied.
2) Be able to generate the varied background. With blinking stars etc.
3) Be able to add movement to the stars in the background in one direction with depth (stars move at different speeds.)
4) To be able to move in a 3D space towards the stars.
